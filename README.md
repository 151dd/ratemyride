# Rate My Ride - Built for the Centro Transport Hack weekend.

- Gets your location using the HTML5 location API and works out which buses you could be on.
- Once you've selected a bus you can send your feedback to the bus operator. Bus information is sent along with it.
- Bus operators can then see live feedback on a dashboard. The live feedback is simulated in this version.

I've removed our Pusher API keys and database endpoints as this is a public repo.
